This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Contact form

The contact form lives at `/contact` and is also embedded on the home page above
the footer (`ContactSection`). Submissions are emailed via [Resend](https://resend.com):

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` (free Resend account) and, optionally, `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`
   / `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL`.
3. Restart the dev server.

Without `RESEND_API_KEY`, the form still submits successfully but messages are
only logged to the server console. The delivery address defaults to
`info@globaldistributer.com` and can be changed with `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` — no code
change needed. Server logic: `src/app/(main)/contact/actions.ts`.
